This plugin integrates your Wordpress with RichTextEditor - the most powerful online wysiwyg content editor.

== Description ==

Rich Text Editor for WordPress [Rich Text Editor for WordPress](http://phphtmleditor.com/wordpress/ "Rich Text Editor for WordPress"1) is by far the fastest, cleanest, most powerful online wysiwyg content editor. It replaces default WordPress wysiwyg(what you see is what you get) editor with a more advanced wysiwyg editor. 

= Some of the features added by this plugin =

* Support for creating and editing tables.
* More options when inserting lists.
* Search and Replace in the editor.
* Ability to set Font Family and Font Size.
* And many others.

Rich Text Editor toolbar is completely configurable and it is also effortless to implement. This Advanced Wordpress Editor plug-in is compatible with the WordPress v. 3.0+.

**#1 cross-browser support**

Most available RTEs fail to support the full spectrum of A-Grade web browsers. Following 9 year old tradition of industry #1 cross-browser support, Rich Text Editor for WordPress continues to offer even better quality and compatibility by supporting all major browsers: IE 6.0+, Firefox 2.0+, Mozilla 1.3+, Netscape 7+, Safari (1.3+), Opera 9.0, IE 9 and Chrome.

**Cleanest html code**

Most WYSIWYG editors are just JavaScript wrappers around the editing control built into browsers such as MSHTML control found in IE. They generate bad markups and then run code clean-up routines against it. By contrast, Rich Text Editor for WordPress is built from the ground up to be a true XHTML editor in its own right.

**Extremely small and fast**

Most feature-rich WYSIWYG editors suffer long loading times due to large javascript files. Rich Text Editor for WordPress only loads the necessaery scripts to client browsers. Numerous optimization methods have been applied. It's clean, compact, extremely fast-loading, but still powerful and efficient.

**Insert clean HTML from Microsoft Word**

***High Reliability, Scalability and High Load Support***

When text is pasted from Microsoft Word a lot of unnecessary word specific markup is carried across. This can result in web pages that take an unnecessarily long time to download. The Paste from Word button solves this by removing word markup before pasting the text into your page
